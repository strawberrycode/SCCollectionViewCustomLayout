# UICollectionView Custom Layout: the Ultimate Tutorial

This project shows the basics about how to create a custom `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` for a `UICollectionView`. 

To cover most of the configurations you can encounter while working on a `UICollectionView`, I created 3 sections with 3 different layouts:
- section 1: a cell with fixed size
- section 2: a cell with a fixed width and a dynamic length
- sections 3 & 4: multiple cells aligned on a grid, with fixed size

I also added resizable headers in the sections 3 and 4.
